# Planning Poker - Pragma

This code implements a planning poker game, which is a challenge proposed by Pragma as part of the company's enrollment process.

Planning poker is a collaborative estimation technique used in agile software development. It involves a group of people, typically the development team, coming together to estimate the effort required to complete a set of user stories or tasks.

In this game, participants take turns to anonymously estimate the effort required for a particular task or user story. Each participant selects a card from a deck of cards, where each card represents a different estimate. The cards are then revealed simultaneously, and the estimates are discussed and compared. This process continues until a consensus is reached on the estimated effort.

This code provides the functionality to facilitate the planning poker game, including managing the deck of cards, collecting and revealing the estimates, and facilitating the discussion and consensus-building process.

Note: This code assumes that the participants and their estimates are already defined and provided as input. It does not handle the actual estimation process or user interaction.
